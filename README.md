# Quant-AQ-Dash

Hello, this is part of an effort to make data from Quant-AQ more visually intuitive and customizable by users who may not have the tools to modify the raw data
from the Quant-AQ API. I am currently working on it alone under Professor Peter DeCarlo at Johns Hopkins University. The bulk of this program is made using Dash 
Enterprise / Plotly with a little bit of CSS / SCSS to make the website at least a little bit more appealing. The Quant-aq_2022.csv may become way too big in the 
future to host on GitHub alone, but I will continue to look for alternatives. Trying to pull from this csv takes around 6 minutes, so I do not recommend doing that.
Instead, just download it and run it locally on your computer. 

# Improvements to be made 

1. Filter bar to filter data above/below a certain threshold. 
This filter feature will enable further customization by the user and make isolating key datapoints easier.

2. General aesthetics of the website. 
Currently, the website looks fine... but I think I have the artistic capability to make this a bit more visually appealing. To be fair, this is completely 
optional and perhaps unnecessary.
